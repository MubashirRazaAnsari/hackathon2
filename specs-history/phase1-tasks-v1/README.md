# Phase I Task List Snapshot

## Phase Overview
This snapshot represents **Phase I** of the Hackathon II project: an in-memory Python CLI Todo application with CRUD operations for tasks. Specifically, this captures the task breakdown for implementation.

## File Included
- `phase1-tasks.md` - Complete task breakdown with 16 atomic, executable tasks

## Finalization Rationale
The task list was finalized to provide a clear, ordered sequence of implementation steps based on the approved specification and plan. Each task includes:
- Unique task ID for tracking
- Detailed description of the work to be done
- Precondition dependencies for proper sequencing
- Implementation scope defining what needs to be built
- Specific files/modules to be modified
- References to relevant sections in both the specification and plan documents

The task breakdown ensures that implementation follows the spec-driven development methodology with no deviation from the approved plan.

## Next Steps
Following the spec-driven development methodology, the next phase is implementation. Each task in the breakdown will be executed in sequence, with implementation strictly following the specifications and plan documented in this snapshot.

The implementation will begin with T-001 (Create Project Structure and Entry Point) and proceed through all 16 tasks until completion of the Phase I application.
