# Phase I Specification and Plan Snapshot

## Phase Overview
This snapshot represents **Phase I** of the Hackathon II project: an in-memory Python CLI Todo application with CRUD operations for tasks.

## Files Included
- `phase1-task-crud.md` - Complete feature specification for Phase I
- `phase1-plan.md` - Implementation plan based on the specification

## Finalization Rationale
The spec and plan were finalized to establish a clear, unambiguous blueprint for implementation. All requirements from the original specification have been captured in the plan, including:

- User stories for add, list, complete, delete, and view operations
- Complete Task domain model with all required attributes
- CLI command behaviors with precise syntax and output formats
- In-memory state management strategy
- Error handling approach
- Module architecture and responsibilities

## Next Steps
Following the spec-driven development methodology, the next phase is to create executable tasks based on this plan. The implementation will proceed with:

1. **Tasks Creation**: Converting the plan into actionable todo items
2. **Implementation**: Developing the application following the specified architecture
3. **Verification**: Ensuring the implementation matches all acceptance criteria

All implementation work will strictly follow the specifications and plan documented in this snapshot.
