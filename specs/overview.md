# Overview of Hackathon II Project

## Project Summary
The Hackathon II project is a comprehensive software development initiative following a spec-driven approach. This project will evolve through five distinct phases, each building upon the previous to deliver a complete solution.

## Project Details
- **Name**: Hackathon II
- **Approach**: Spec-Driven Development
- **AI Assistant**: Claude
- **Script Type**: sh
- **Target**: Single evolving project covering Phase I → Phase V

## Phase Descriptions

### Phase I: Foundation
- Establish core architecture
- Set up development environment
- Define initial specifications
- Create basic project structure

### Phase II: Core Features
- Implement essential functionality
- Develop primary user interfaces
- Create core business logic
- Establish data models

### Phase III: Integration
- Connect different components
- Implement API integrations
- Handle data flow between systems
- Ensure component interoperability

### Phase IV: Optimization
- Performance improvements
- Code refactoring and cleanup
- Security enhancements
- Scalability improvements

### Phase V: Deployment
- Production environment setup
- Deployment pipeline creation
- Monitoring and logging implementation
- Final testing and validation

## Governance
- Specifications are maintained in the `specs/` directory
- Historical versions are tracked in `specs-history/`
- Decision-making follows the constitution in `specs/constitution.md`
- AI interactions are documented in `CLAUDE.md`

## Next Steps
1. Refine Phase I specifications
2. Begin foundational architecture work
3. Establish development workflows
4. Set up project tracking mechanisms
