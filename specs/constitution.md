# Constitution for Hackathon II Project

## Purpose
This document establishes the foundational principles and governance structure for the Hackathon II project, following Spec-Kit Plus conventions for spec-driven development.

## Project Scope
The Hackathon II project encompasses a single evolving project covering Phase I through Phase V, with each phase building upon the previous to deliver a comprehensive solution.

## Phases
- **Phase I: Foundation** - Core architecture and setup
- **Phase II: Core Features** - Essential functionality implementation
- **Phase III: Integration** - Connecting components and systems
- **Phase IV: Optimization** - Performance and efficiency improvements
- **Phase V: Deployment** - Production readiness and delivery

## Development Principles
- Spec-first approach: All features must be specified before implementation
- Evolutionary design: Specifications evolve iteratively across phases
- AI-assisted development: Claude as the primary AI assistant
- Continuous governance: Regular review and update of specifications

## Decision-Making Process
All major decisions must be documented in the relevant specification files, with clear rationale and stakeholder input.

## Version Control
Specifications are maintained in the specs/ directory, with historical versions tracked in specs-history/.

## Compliance
All development activities must align with the principles and processes defined in this constitution.
